# WaterSensor

Welcome to **WaterSensor** â€“ an Arduino and Python project that reads water sensor values and processes them. This project is part of my 100-day challenge, and today is **Day 8/100**. I'm excited to share my progress with you!

## About WaterSensor

WaterSensor is designed to capture data from a water sensor using an Arduino and process the data using a Python script. The project is ideal for monitoring water levels or detecting water presence in various applications.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **Arduino**: For reading data from the water sensor.
- **Python**: For processing and analyzing the sensor data.

## Project Structure

- **arduino/**:
  - **main.ino**: Arduino code to read data from the water sensor.
- **python/**:
  - **main.py**: Python script to read data from the Arduino and process it.

## Components

The following components are required for this project:

- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
- Water sensor
- Connecting wires
- USB cable to connect the Arduino to the computer

## Setup

To set up and run the WaterSensor, follow these steps:

1. **Download the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/scriptsorcery4/WaterSensor-Day8-100-.git
    cd WaterSensor-Day8-100-
    ```

2. **Upload the Arduino code**:

    - Open `main.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
    - Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
    - Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
    - Click the upload button to transfer the code to the Arduino.

3. **Run the Python script**:

    - Run the data processor script:

        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```
